The page shows a conversation between two characters in what appears to be a dark, industrial underground setting. The scene is dominated by blue and green lighting, creating an ominous atmosphere. The left side of the page shows a taller figure in conversation with someone about "tunnels" and infrastructure, discussing how people have been "running from those things." The character mentions having lived there for a while to avoid something.
In the middle and right panels, we see one of the characters wearing distinctive blue-glowing goggles or a visor, holding what appears to be a device. The conversation reveals they've been working on some kind of "pulse" system that causes chaos. The mood is tense and conspiratorial, with the characters discussing resistance and fighting back against some form of threat.
The final panels show what appears to be an underground parking or storage area, with industrial pipes and a police car visible. The lighting remains cold and eerie with those signature blue-green tones, maintaining the comic's cyberpunk or dystopian atmosphere.
