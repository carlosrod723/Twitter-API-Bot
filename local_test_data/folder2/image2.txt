The upper portion of the page is set in a dark, industrial space with blue-green lighting. Two characters are having a tense conversation - one wearing distinctive blue-glowing goggles sitting on what appears to be a counter or ledge, and another in a green jacket standing nearby. They discuss how their location used to be a "popular stop" before "everything fell" and how they've put enough distance between themselves and "the city." The scene conveys a sense of survivors in hiding, with dialogue suggesting they're evading some group called "cyborgs."
The lower portion of the page shifts dramatically to a brighter, warmer-colored classroom setting. A teacher figure in teal/turquoise clothing is speaking to a student about exceptional test results. The scene has a retrospective feel, with the teacher explaining that the student's abilities have "raised attention from certain organizations." This appears to be a flashback showing a pivotal moment in the student's past.
The page ends with a dramatic orange-red panel suggesting some kind of explosive or intense moment, using classic comic book action lines to create tension.
The contrast between the dark, dystopian present and the bright, ordinary past creates a compelling narrative juxtaposition that hints at how the character's life changed dramatically.
