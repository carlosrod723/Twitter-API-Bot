This dramatic comic page is split into several intense panels that tell a story of revelation and trauma. On the left, a large vertical panel shows a character holding what appears to be a tablet or electronic device, bathed in dramatic orange and red lighting effects. The character appears almost manic or transformed, with the text "THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE" emphasized in red letters, suggesting a pivotal moment of realization or decision.
The right side of the page is divided into smaller panels that convey increasing tension and revelation. It begins with a character screaming "AHHHH!" in stark terror, followed by panels showing their distressed state as they recount memories of an event called "Pandia." The narrative describes a catastrophic scenario where "the whole damn country fell apart," illustrated by a sepia-toned panel showing robotic or armored figures marching through destroyed city streets.
The final panel reveals darker undertones about "experiments" and "human augmentation," with dialogue suggesting secret tests and technological enhancements were being conducted. The character appears haunted by these memories, curled up in a defensive posture as they recount these traumatic events.
The page effectively uses color and panel composition to transition from a moment of realization to the horror of remembered trauma, creating a powerful emotional impact.
