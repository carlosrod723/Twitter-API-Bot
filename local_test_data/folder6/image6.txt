The top panel depicts two figures against a backdrop sharply divided between black and white. On the left, bathed in shadow, is a young man with spiky hair, leaning forward with a hand partially obscuring his face, his expression unreadable, but perhaps hinting at worry or introspection. He's wearing a casual, collared shirt and jeans. On the right, standing in bright light, is another young man, bald, with a wide, almost unnervingly cheerful grin. He's making a "peace" sign with his fingers. He is also casually dressed in a long-sleeved shirt and jeans. The stark light and shadow difference between them suggests opposing personalities or roles, perhaps even a symbolic representation of internal conflict. The line where light meets dark is jagged, and almost looks like a jagged crack.

The bottom panel shows a hospital scene. An elderly man lies in a hospital bed, seemingly asleep or unconscious, connected to various medical devices, including an IV drip and what appears to be a heart monitor. The lines are stark and detailed, highlighting the sterile, impersonal nature of the setting. He is wearing a hospital gown. The man's hand rests near his face, and the tubes and wires create a sense of vulnerability and perhaps impending mortality. The overall mood is somber and quiet, contrasting sharply with the more ambiguous and potentially dynamic interaction in the panel above. The complete lack of shading gives the bottom panel a very "flat" look, emphasizing the two-dimensional nature of the image.
